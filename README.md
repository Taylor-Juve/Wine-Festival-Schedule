Codecademy's HTML Table project made by matching my output to sample output, step-by-step.

Again, I worked on my own then went to their steps to check my work. I completed one table row then the rest, they completed the same sub elements of each row together. I like my method still because I was matching outputs. 

My method was a top to bottom approach, checking output after each section of work. I used the .css file to determine the right HTML elements to apply, mostly to find the right h2 or h3. 

Less code this time but checking the .css to help match styles was interesting.
